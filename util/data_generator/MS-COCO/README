This folder helps you with preparing MS-COCO dataset.

What we will do is to download label information and raw images, which are then converted to numpy arrays.

1. Go to https://cocodataset.org/#download to download annotations and images. There are different dataset splits available. Here we use the 2014 data as an example.
2. Install COCO API https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi so that we can retrieve labels for each image. Also install pillow module in order to manipulate with the image.
3. With all materials, we can convert raw images into numpy arrays with convert_to_array() function in the convert_to_array file. Note that you may need to run it twice, one for training set and another for testing set. This step agains around 12 hours.
4. Finally, do a testing and training data split using split_test_train() function.
