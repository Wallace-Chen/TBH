This folder helps you with preparing NUS-WIDE dataset.

What we will do is to download label information and raw images, which are then converted to numpy arrays.
Note the downloading raw images could takes very long time (~24 hours), or one could implement a multi-thread program, which is not considered here.

1. Go to https://lms.comp.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/research/nuswide/NUS-WIDE to download Groudtruth, Concept List, Image List, Image Urls.
2. Preprocess label information to filter labels with at least 5000 samples with save_top_concept() function in the preprocess.py file.
3. Run save_map() function in the download_convert.py to construct a mapping from uid to the pid(photo id) to be used later to retrieve photo easier.
4. Now download raw images using download_relevent_pics() function. Again this may take quite a long time (~24 hours).
5. Install pillow module to play with images. Given raw images, we need to convert them into numpy arrays and build the link to the corresponding labels, using convert_to_array() function. This step again takes quite a long time (~12 hours)
6. Finally, do a testing and training data split using split_test_train() function.
